# Mach-O dependency tree walker

Gets list of input files from positional arguments or package listings and walks dependency tree of each architecture independently. Binaries with missing dependencies are marked.

#### Limitations
- Currently doesn't support any of the DYLD_* environment variables that affect dyld search -- there is no place for those in production environments anyway.
- Doesn't make any attempt to resolve imported symbols.

# Filing bugs

Please use GitHub issue tracker. Search for an existing bug or create a new one and add reproduction steps and a description of what goes wrong. Or fix it and create a pull request.

# Environment

- python 3.x
- macholib 1.7 
    - ```pip3 install macholib```
- best used on OSX

# Standard output and log format

Dependency tree is printed with a 3 flag prefix: ```[MES]``` Missing, Excluded, System. Then follows dependency name (load command) and resolved absolute path (if found).

##### Resolved system file:
```
	[  S] /usr/lib/libz.1.dylib -> /usr/lib/libz.1.dylib
```

##### Resolved rpath dependency
```
	[   ] @rpath/QtCore.framework/Versions/5/QtCore -> /Library/Application Support/SMART Technologies/Frameworks/Qt5.4.1/QtCore.framework/Versions/5/QtCore
```

# JSON report format

Report is a slightly cleaned up dump of node cache generated while processing dependencies. Root object is a flat unordered array of nodes. Each node represents a Mach-O binary either found in one of inspected packages or at explicitly specified paths or a dependency binary. Relations between nodes can be recovered by searching for full Node based on Node.Arch.DependencyNode.

##### Root object
```javascript
[array of Nodes]
```

##### Node
```javascript
{
   	path: string // absolute resolved path to the binary (if found), partially resolved dependency name if not found
   	package: string // package name if this node was found in a package specified by --pkgs
    root: bool, optional // true if node is a root node (explicitly specified as opposed to being a dependency) 
    excluded: bool, optional // true if node matched anything in exclusion list
	exists: bool // true if binary was found on the system
	parsed: bool // true if binary was successfully parsed
	system: bool // true if system is declared to be a system binary (located in /usr/lib or /System/Library, see isSystemLib())
	satisfied: bool, optional // true if all dependencies of this node are found or excluded by one of exclusion rules
	restrictarch: string, optional // name of required architecture (when this node is a dependency of another node)
	@loader_path: string, optional // resolved value of @loader_path as dyld would see it
	@executable_path: string, optional // resolved value of @executable_path as dyld would see it (set and tracked through whole dependency tree when tree starts from an executable)
	parentRpathStack: [array of strings] // resolved RPATH stack, tracked from the start of dependency tree. See dyld manual for more info, TL;DR -- expanded rpaths are cascading down dependency chain
	arch: { "architecture name": Arch }
	missing: [array of DependencyNodes] // list of missing dependencies
}
```

##### Arch
```javascript
{
	name: string // architecture name, "x86_64", etc
	rpaths: [array of strings] // list of resolved rpaths found in this binary
	dependencies: [array of DependencyNodes]
}
```

##### DependencyNode
```javascript
{
    name: string // name of the dependency as recorded in load Mach-O commands
    path: string, optional // full resolved path if found on system
    excluded: bool
    system: bool
    restrictArch: string
    parentRpathStack: [array of strings] 
    @executable_path: string, optional
}
```

# Exclusions file format
- Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.
- Each line is a separate regexp that must match full "exclusion ID" of a dependency, where ID is built using full ancestry and absolute dependency path (or name, as given by load command, when path is not resolved), separated by ' : ' (space-colon-space). 
For example:
```
# Ignore missing dependencies that start with '@rpath' on all embedded frameworks for all apps in /Application folder.
# Because they might rely on rpath being set in parent executable.
# At the same time do not ignore those dependencies when frameworks are loaded by something else.
# That needs correct rpath set to work and is usually a legitimate error.
/Applications/.*\.app/Contents/Frameworks/[^:]*\.framework/.* : @rpath/.*
```
- Exclusion IDs and regexp patterns that match them are printed with verbosity 100+.

# Usage

```./collect_macho_report.py [--exclusions <PATH>] [--ignoresystem] [--teamcity] [--verbosity <INT>] [--log <PATH>] [--report <PATH>] <[--pkgs <REGEXP>] ... | [PATH] ...>```

- ```--exclusions <PATH>```
	Path to exclusions file -- dependencies matching anything inside will be automatically marked as resolved and will not affect status of the parent.
- ```--teamcity```
	Autodetected when run by TeamCityÂ®, formats standard output messages as ```##teamcity[message ...]``` for TeamCity build log integration.
- ```--verbosity <INT>```
	Default value: 1.
	- 0 -- output nothing but missing dependencies.
	- 1~6 -- general information about processed binaries, increasingly more verbose.
	- 101+ -- debug output.
- ```--ignoresystem```
	Stops tree traversal at binaries installed in /System/Library and /usr/lib, eliminates ~60k nodes. Highly recommended.
- ```--pkgs <REGEXP>```
	Get input file list from installed packages matching REGEXP. See ```/usr/sbin/pkgutil --help``` for more info. Can be specified multiple times.
- ```--log <PATH>```
	Path to log file. Log follows stdout format, but ignores teamcity and is always at full verbosity.
- ```--report <PATH>```
	Path to json dump of processed nodes.
- ```[PATH ...]```
	One or more file or directory paths. All Mach-O binaries found will be added to input file list to be processed. Can be used together with ```--pkgs``` option.

# Examples

### Installation check
Check dyld dependencies for all Mach-O binaries installed by SMART Technologies, using exclusion file with known irrelevancies and writing both log and JSON dump (for processing elsewhere).
```
python3 collect_macho_report.py --verbosity 0 --pkgs "com.smarttech.*" --ignoresystem --exclusions "esi_exclusions_osx.txt" --log "log.txt" --report "report.json"
```
With verbosity 0 anything on stdout basically means there are missing dependencies and installation is broken.

### Single app check
Check dyld dependencies for all Mach-O binaries found under specified application bundle.
```
python3 collect_macho_report.py /Applications/SMART\ Technologies/SMART\ Tools/SMART\ Product\ Update.app --verbosity 3 --ignoresystem
```
Output:
